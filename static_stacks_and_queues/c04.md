# Static Stacks and Queues

## Exercise 4 (task)

As evident from the demonstration of a linear queue in Exercise 3, linear queues suffer from an issue called **Queue Creep**.

You would have noticed that whenever the tail pointer reached the end of the array, no matter how many items we dequeue from the queue, the queue would always be full. This is because the act of dequeueing shifts the head pointer to the right, leaving a lot of **wasted space** at the start of the array.

This means that once N items are enqueued to the queue, where N is the size of the underlying array, the queue would forever be full, even if you dequeue from the queue. This is very inefficient!

To solve this issue, we can improve a Linear Queue to become a Circular Queue! A circular queue still uses the two head and tail pointers, but we are allowed to "wrap around" the head and tail index pointers back to 0 whenever there is no space left at the end of the array. This allows u to **reuse** the wasted space at the start of the array.

E.g. If `MAXSIZE` = 100, `head` = 5, `tail` = 99, then `tail` would become 0 after the next enqueue operation, and can continue increasing until it has filled in all of the free space before the `head` index.

Complete the code to implement a circular queue.

# Static Stacks and Queues

## Exercise 1 (example)

Stacks are a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure that can be implemented either statically or dynamically.

Dynamically will be saved for objected oriented programming in the next tutorial. In this exercise, we focus on implementing stacks statically using an array concept.

An array is conceptually of fixed-size at runtime so we maintain as list whose length we will not change once initialised because static data structures cannot change their size at runtime.

Static stacks require one pointer - the top pointer to indciate the index of the current top of the stack. Since static stacks have a maximum size given by the maximum size of the array, if an item is pushed to a stack which is already full, there would be a stack overflow error which we simulate here.

The main methods associated with a stack are:

- `push`: add an item to the stack
- `pop`: remove an item from the stack and return it
- `peek`: return the item at the top of the stack without removing it
- `isEmpty`: checks if the stack is empty
- `isFull`: checks if the stack is full, only applicable for a static stack

In exercise 1, there is an example implementation of a static stack.

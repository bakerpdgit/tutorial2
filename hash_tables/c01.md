# Hash Tables

## Exercise 1 (example)

A hash table is a fundamental data structure that creates a **mapping between keys and values** by **applying a hash function** to the key to get an **address** where the value is stored, typically in an **array**. Hash tables are a way of implementing a dictionary, which is a collection of key-value pairs accessed via the key, but keep in mind that hash tables are **not the same** as dictionaries.

The use of the **hash function** is to be able to **quickly lookup** the value associated with a key in the hash table by computing the address from the key, and accessing the value stored in the array at the given address. Ideally, the time complexity of accessing an item in a hash table is **O(1)**, meaning that the time to access an item doesn't depend on how big the hash table is. However, this time complexity can degrade down to **O(N)** in the worst case due to collisions (will discuss later in this chapter).

This example shows an implementation of a hash table along with a simple hash function that underpins it. This set of exercises uses Object Oriented Programming, so if you aren't familiar with OOP, take a look at the section of chapters on OOP.

# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 1 (example)

Programming is usually learned through small examples: programs have a few dozen lines at most and do a simple task.
But real-world applications are far larger, with multiple interacting features developed by separate programmers in a
codebase of many files. This scale demands more organisation than can be provided by simple programming constructs.

The main aim of object-oriented programming is to provide this organisation. Code is divided into methods, objects, and
modules which each have a single responsibility, with objects depending only loosely on each other. This allows
programmers to work on one section of code each without being directly involved in other sections.

Don't worry about understanding the program opposite yet, but observe that while it is large, the use of OOP principles
keeps it organised.

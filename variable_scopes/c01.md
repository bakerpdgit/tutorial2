# Variable scopes

## Exercise 1 (example)

In Python, each function defines its own scope. A scope is a region in which variables are assigned and accessible: so
a variable declared in one function cannot be accessed in another function. This is done so that unrelated functions
in different parts of code can use the same variable names without interfering with each other.

Any code outside a function is also part of its own scope, called the global scope. Unlike variables in within different
functions, variables in the global scope can be read from within a function, though by default they cannot be assigned
to. Assigning to a variable means using an equals sign directly on that variable name: so modifying a value in a list,
for instance, is not assignment.

In order to assign to a variable in the outer scope from within a function, the `global` keyword can be used at the top
of the function.

Run this code which uses the `global` keyword to update `num_nosies_made` each time the function is run. Note that the
variable `animal_noises` is not used with the keyword, because it need only be read.

# Data structures as parameters
## Exercise 3 (example)

Be careful if you pass in a mutable (changeable) variable such as a list into a function as a parameter.

If you change it within the function, you will have changed the original as well which you may or may not want.

Tip: to stop the outside list from changing, you could first create a list copy using e.g. `temp_lst = list(lst)` at the start of the function.

# Dictionaries and sets

## Exercise 4 (task)

Fill in the blanks to create a program to manage geographical trivia.

Iterating through a dictionary with a `for` loop will give you the keys only. Similarly, checking membership with `in`
works by key, not value. You can also get a list of keys using `dict.keys()` or a list of values with `dict.values()`.

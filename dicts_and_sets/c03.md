# Dictionaries and sets

## Exercise 3 (example)

Consider this example of a phone book. We associate each name with a phone number. (The numbers used aren't real!)

One basic way to implement this is as two lists: one for names, and one for numbers. However, it's a bit complicated to
access numbers given names, and we have to maintain both lists separately if we ever want to modify the phone book. This
becomes even worse if we want to keep track of additional data about each contact.

An alternative is to use records (see "Creating and using records"). We could use named tuples or dataclasses, but in
this example tuples are used for simplicity. Using one list makes it easier to maintain, but at the cost of even more
complicated syntax for lookup. Looking up numbers in this way is also slow for large lists.

The solution is a new class: dictionaries. A dictionary tracks a mapping between two types of data. Here the **keys**
are names and the **values** are numbers. The dictionary is declared as a comma-separated sequence of `key: value`
pairs, all enclosed in curly brackets. Then we can read and write to individual elements using square bracket access
like a list, putting the key in the brackets rather than a numeric index.

Like sets, dictionaries require keys to be hashable, though values need not be hashable.
